# User-Behaviour-Monitoring-Algorithm
Many practitioners in information security believe that promoting good human behaviours and constraining bad behaviours provide one important method for preventing the organisation from being exposed to human-related information security risks. Because of the significance of human behaviour and the fact that it may be a source of threat to the organisation, having an AI-driven approach to analyse the different kinds of risky human behaviour can provide helpful benefits for IT managers, information security specialists, and others with an interest in assessing and guiding information security-related human behaviour. AI algorithms can be deployed to monitor and analyse user behaviour patterns and then report or block undesirable or suspicious ones. For this approach to be effective, it is necessary to understand the various algorithms and types involved in detecting human activity and differentiate good and bad behaviour.  The algorithm needs to be trained on a dataset to gain knowledge of what constitutes bad and good human behaviour. 

This repo contains the code to my Project entitled LEVERAGING CROWD-SOURCED AI ALGORITHMS TO GUIDE INFORMATION SECURITY BEHAVIOUR.

The main objective of the project is to monitor and analyse user behaviour patterns and then differentiate good and bad behaviour using information from a specific dataset (a link to a sample dataset is also given).

This AI and machine learning algorithm seeks to:

track users' activity,
recognize user behaviour,
classify user behaviour based on the attributes in the dataset
categorize user behaviour into either bad or good behaviour if they satisfy conditions.

# Ideas for improvements
Note that this repository may not contain all the required information for creating an AI solution to the stated problem. Contributors are therefore more than welcome to provide other external data if possible.

# Not yet implemented
This code is just a guideline and it has not been evaluated nor implemented. The idea is to crowdsource a working solution from this platform based on the objectives stated above.

# License
There is none. The solution code, however, may or may not be based on the source code of existing work versions provided it falls under fair use and does not violate copyright law.

Working with this source code is fine, but would also consider new external work with similar objectives.

PS: Hey buddy! If you're reading this, I would love to have a proper project, on an officially sanctioned remaster. Please get in touch!
