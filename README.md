# User-Behaviour-Monitoring-Algorithm
Many practitioners in information security believe that promoting good human behaviours and constraining bad behaviours provide one important method for preventing the organisation form being exposed to human-related information security risks. Because of the significance of human behaviour and the fact that it may be a source of threat to the organisation, having an AI-driven approach to analyse the different kinds of risky human behaviour can provide helpful benefits for IT managers, information security specialists, and others with an interest in assessing and guiding information security-related human behaviour. AI algorithms can be deployed to monitor and analyse user behaviour patterns and then report or block the undesirable or suspicious ones. For this approach to be effective, it is necessary to understand the various algorithms and types involved in detecting human activity and differentiate good and bad behaviour.  Algorithms needs to be trained on a dataset to gain knowledge of what constitutes bad and good human behaviour. 

This repo contains the code to my Project entitled LEVERAGING CROWD-SOURCED AI ALGORITHMS TO GUIDE INFORMATION SECURITY BEHAVIOUR.

The main objective of the project is to monitor and analyse user behaviour patterns and then differentiate good and bad behaviour using information from a specific dataset (a link to a sample dataset is also given).

This AI and machine learning algorithms seeks to:

track users activity,
recognize user behaviour,
classify user behaviour based on the attributes in the dataset
categorize user behaviour into either bad or good behaviour if they satisfy conditions.
